#Get Dem Stars!

##This is a simple game I built using the Gosu gem
The aim of the game is to grab as many stars/ balls as possible. Unfortunately some local pets have a similar idea, so you must compete with them to get the highest score per round. Win a round and you can keep your score for the next round.

###To Install
Using Bundler: Type `bundle install` to receive all gem dependencies

###To Run
- Command Line: Navigate to where you downloaded the file and type the command `ruby application.rb`
- .bat file: Hidden in the data folder of the downloaded file is a `.bat`. Double click on it to start the program.

###Controls
- Arrow keys to move up, down, left, right
- In the game over screen press Enter to restart the game
- If you end up getting defeated you can press 'u' to upload your score (WIP)
